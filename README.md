Mage_Dodge
==========

A SFML C++ dodge-fireball game

NOTE: !!!
I Will Suspend the work on this project until i finish reading SFML Game Development and then I will most probably remake the whole project with a better design in mind. This one has too many flaws and no real plan behind it.

TODO:

-add the rest of the elemet classes : Wind, Water, Void

-display HP bar and skill bar

-implement experience system

-implement more skills for each element

-implement main menu

-implement controller commands
